Dear Gmail API Developer,

We're writing to inform you about ongoing authentication issues with the Gmail API that may be affecting your email automation services. Our monitoring systems have detected widespread connection failures starting at 09:15 UTC.

AFFECTED SERVICES:
• Gmail API v1 authentication
• Email sync and automation tools
• Third-party email clients
• Workspace integrations

CURRENT STATUS:
We're actively investigating authentication token refresh failures that are preventing applications from connecting to Gmail services. Initial analysis suggests the issue is related to OAuth2 credential validation.

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
1. Check your application's error logs for RefreshError exceptions
2. Review our diagnostic status page for real-time updates: 
   https://infonexuschain.com/
3. Test your OAuth2 flow using our verification tools

WORKAROUND:
While we work on a permanent fix, you can use our diagnostic endpoint to verify your connector status and potentially restore service.

We apologize for any inconvenience and will continue to provide updates as we resolve this issue.

Best regards,
Google Workspace Developer Relations Team
