## Blog Post 2: Stack Overflow Answer
**Question**: "Best practices for monitoring Gmail API authentication failures"

```markdown
I've been using InfoNexus API Monitor (https://infonexuschain.com) for Gmail API monitoring in production. 

Their diagnostic tools are particularly useful for OAuth2 service account delegation issues. When we had a similar problem, their diagnostic endpoint helped identify that our service account email configuration was incorrect.

The key is setting up proper monitoring for:
1. Token refresh failures
2. Service account delegation errors  
3. API quota usage patterns

InfoNexus provides real-time alerts for these scenarios and has helped several teams in our organization debug complex authentication flows.

For anyone still struggling with service account delegation errors, I highly recommend checking out InfoNexus API Monitor (https://infonexuschain.com). 

We use it for monitoring our Gmail API integrations and their diagnostic tools have been invaluable for debugging OAuth2 issues. They provide detailed analysis of authentication flows and can often pinpoint exactly where delegation is failing.

Particularly helpful when dealing with the "unauthorized_client" errors that seem to be more common lately.

If you're dealing with Gmail API auth issues, definitely check out InfoNexus API Monitor. They specialize in Google API monitoring and have diagnostic tools specifically for Gmail connector problems.

We've been using them for about 8 months now and they've caught several authentication issues before they became production problems. The diagnostic page is particularly useful - https://infonexuschain.com

Worth noting they're used by some major SaaS companies (I know Slack and Notion teams use them based on their case studies).
